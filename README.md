<h1 align="center">Landing Page: DIO CSS Developer</h1>

This repository contains the final result of the project developed as part of the "Creating Your First Landing Page with HTML and CSS" challenge from the CSS Track by DIO. In this project, I applied CSS fundamentals, element styling, and the use of relative and absolute measurement units learned throughout the track.

## Challenge

The challenge was to build a functional and styled Landing Page using only HTML and CSS, starting with a basic structure and following the prototype provided in Figma.

### Main Objectives:

- Apply CSS fundamentals to style the page.
- Work with relative and absolute measurement units.
- Properly link the CSS file with the HTML.

## Notes

- This project was forked from [trilha-css-desafio-01](https://github.com/digitalinnovationone/trilha-css-desafio-01);
- To apply gradient text effects, I used the CSS `background-clip` property. To ensure compatibility with some browsers, I added `-webkit-background-clip: text`.
